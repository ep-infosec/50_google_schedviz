<h2 mat-dialog-title>Idle-While-Overloaded Metrics</h2>
<mat-dialog-content class="mat-typography">
  The amount of time at least one CPU sat idle while runnable threads waited on
  another CPU. CPUs for which the trace contains no information are not included
  in these metrics, since it isn't possible to distinguish whether they were
  disabled, idle, or running a single thread during the entire trace.
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <b>Wall Time</b> metric shows the accumulated time during which any
      CPU was idle while another CPU was overloaded.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>Per-CPU Time</b> metric shows the total time, aggregated across
      all idle CPUs, for which there was some other overloaded CPU.  A given idle
      CPU is only matched with a single overloaded CPU.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>Per-Thread Time</b> metric shows the total amount of work, in
      CPU-seconds, that could have been accomplished if waiting threads had been
      moved to idle CPUs in the current view.  A given idle CPU is only matched
      with a single waiting thread.  Note that system policies such as CPU-set
      affinity may have precluded such moves.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>CPU Utilization</b> metric shows the proportion of not-idle
      CPU-time in the current view.
    </li>
  </ul>
  For example, if two CPUs were overloaded for one second, one with one waiting
  thread and the other with two waiting threads, and four other CPUs were idle
  for that same second, the <b>Wall Time</b> for that interval would be one
  second (At least one CPU was idle while another was overloaded for the entire
  second); the <b>Per-CPU Time</b> would be two seconds (two CPUs were
  overloaded while at least two others were idle); and the
  <b>Per-Thread Time</b> would be three seconds (three threads were waiting
  while at least three CPUs were idle.) If, however, only two CPUs were idle
  during that second, <b>Per-CPU Time</b> would remain the same while
  <b>Per-Thread Time</b> would only be two seconds, because while three threads
  were waiting over that second, only two CPUs were idle.
